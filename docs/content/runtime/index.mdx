> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide assumes that you have a homebrew enabled Switch. If you don't,
> you can follow the [NH Switch Guide](https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/)
> to get started.
>
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) must also be installed on your development machine,
> in order to run the tooling described in this guide.

To get started on creating your nx.js application, it is recommended that you start with one of the [templates](https://github.com/TooTallNate/nx.js/tree/main/apps) and modify the source code from there.

Each template is configured with:

 * TypeScript types properly configured for your code editor
 * A `build` script which utilizes [`esbuild`][] to bundle the application into a single file
 * A `nro` script to package your application into a standalone `.nro` file (which can be launched from the Switch Homebrew menu)
 * A `nsp` script to package your application into a standalone `.nsp` file (which can be installed to and launched from the homescreen)

## Clone a template

Create a new nx.js application by running the [`create-nxjs-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-nxjs-app) tool:

<InstallTabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    <Tab value='npm'>

```bash
npx create-nxjs-app@latest
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm create nxjs-app@latest
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value='yarn'>

```bash
yarn create nxjs-app@latest
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value='bun'>

```bash
bun create nxjs-app@latest
```

    </Tab>

</InstallTabs>

You will be prompted with the list of example applications to select from, as well as the name
of your application and a few other personalization options.

In the end, you will have a new directory which contains the cloned template for you to begin tinkering with.

## Bundle the source code

nx.js evaluates a single JavaScript file at runtime. It does _not_ implement a module loader. Therefore,
when separating your application code into multiple files, it is the responsibility of a _bundler_ to
combine the source files into a singular "bundle", which is the code that nx.js runs.

All of the example templates are pre-configured to use [`esbuild`][], but you can use a different bundler
if you prefer, such as Parcel or Rollup.

Run the `build` script to bundle the application into the `romfs/main.js` file, which is the entrypoint
of the nx.js app:

```bash
npm run build
```

> [!TIP]
> You may place other files within the `romfs` directory, and they will become embedded within the RomFS
> filesystem in the final executable. This is useful for assets such as images, fonts, and other
> data files. You can read files from the RomFS partition by using the `romfs:/` URL protocol.

## Package the executable

Now that the `romfs` directory is populated with the main app bundle (and possibly other assets), you can
package the application into a standalone `.nro` file (which can be launched from the Switch Homebrew menu).

```bash
npm run nro
```

This will result in a `<your app name>.nro` file in the root directory of your project. You can then upload
this file to Switch via FTP or directly copy it to the SD card, and then launch the app from the homebrew menu.
