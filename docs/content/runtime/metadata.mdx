For distribution, you will likely want to customize the metadata for your application, as well as use a custom icon:
* Metadata information can be specified by adding specific properties to the `package.json` file
* The icon can be specified by adding an `icon.jpg` file to the root of your project

<Screenshot src={HbmenuScreenshot} />

## Title ID

The title ID of your application is used to uniquely identify your application. This is
primarily relevant when utilizing the [Save Data API](/runtime/concepts/save-data) via `localStorage`.

To set the title ID of your application, add a `titleId` property to your `package.json` file.
It should contain a 16-character hexadecimal string which starts with `01` and ends with `0000`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "titleId": "0123456789ab0000"
}
```

> [!TIP]
> The `create-nxjs-app` tool automatically generates a random title ID for you,
> so normally you will not need to create this property manually.

## Name

To set the title of your application (as shown in the homebrew menu), add either a
[`productName`](https://www.electron.build/configuration.html#productname) (as made popular by Electron)
or [`name`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#name) property
to your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "productName": "My Application",
  "name": "my-application"
}
```

> [!TIP]
> `productName` takes precedence over `name`, and allows for a "pretty" name to be
> displayed for your app. But it's recommended to specify both properties, since
> package managers will complain if `name` is missing.

## Version

To set the version of your application, add a [`version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#version) property to your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

## Author

To set the author of your application, add an [`author`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#people-fields-author-contributors) property to your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "author": "Barney Rubble <b@rubble.com>"
}
```

## Icon

To set the icon of your application, add an `icon.jpg` file to the root of your project:

<Files>
  <File name="icon.jpg" />
  <File name="package.json" />
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <File name="main.ts" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

> [!NOTE]
> The icon should be a square image. It will be resized to 256x256 pixels. If this file is
> not present, then the default nx.js icon will be used.
