For distribution, you will likely want to customize the metadata for your application, as well as use a custom icon:
* Metadata information can be specified by adding specific properties to the `package.json` file
* The icon can be specified by adding an `icon.jpg` file to the root of your project

<Screenshot src={HbmenuScreenshot} />

## ID

The title ID of your application is used to uniquely identify your application. This is
primarily relevant when utilizing the [Save Data API](/runtime/concepts/save-data) via `localStorage`.

To set the title ID of your application, add the `nacp.id` property to your `package.json` file.
It should contain a 16-character hexadecimal string which starts with `01` and ends with `0000`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "nacp": {
    "id": "0123456789ab0000"
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> The `create-nxjs-app` tool automatically generates a random title ID for you,
> so normally you will not need to create this property manually.

## Title

To set the title of your application (as will be shown in the homebrew menu),
add the `nacp.title` property in your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-application",
  "nacp": {
    "title": "My Application"
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Setting `nacp.title` is preferred since it allows for spaces, uppercase characters, etc.
> If not defined, then the root-level `name` property will be used.

## Version

To set the version of your application, add a [`version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#version) property to your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

## Author

To set the author of your application, add an [`author`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#people-fields-author-contributors) property to your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "author": "Barney Rubble <b@rubble.com>"
}
```

## Icon

To set the icon of your application, add an `icon.jpg` file to the root of your project:

<Files>
  <File name="icon.jpg" />
  <File name="package.json" />
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <File name="main.ts" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

> [!NOTE]
> The icon should be a square image. It will be resized to 256x256 pixels. If this file is
> not present, then the default nx.js icon will be used.
