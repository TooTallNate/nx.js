description: Handling user input on connected controllers
---

nx.js supports up to __eight__ connected controllers. Your application can use the web
[Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API) to read the
state of these controllers.

The `navigator.getGamepads()` function returns an array (always with a length of `8`)
containing either `Gamepad` instances, or `null` for indicies where the controller is
not connected.

> Index `0` of the gamepads array is the "main" gamepad, which is a special case that reports the state of both the first connected controller as well as the handheld mode controller.

## Example

```js
function update() {
  requestAnimationFrame(update);

  const pads = navigator.getGamepads();
  const playerOne = pads[0];
  if (playerOne.buttons[0].pressed) {
    console.log('Button "B" is being pressed on the first controller');
  }
}

update();
```
