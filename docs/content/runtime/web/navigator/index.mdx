The `navigator` global is implemented partly for web compatibility purposes,
but also to expose various system based functionality using web APIs, which
your nx.js app can utilize:

  * Handling user input using `navigator.getGamepads()`
  * Read the console's battery level via `navigator.getBattery()`
  * Triggering the virtual keyboard through `navigator.virtualKeyboard`
  * Vibrating the console with `navigator.vibrate()`
