title: File System
description: Performing file system operations
---

nx.js provides various functions for performing file system operations in your nx.js app. Since there is no universally
agreed upon API by the current leading JavaScript runtimes, nx.js implements its own file system APIs which take inspiration
from other runtimes.

Some key differences compared to what you might be used to in Node.js:

* Read functions ([`Switch.readFile()`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/functions/readFile),
  [`Switch.stat()`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/functions/stat), etc.) return `null` if
  a given path does not exist (they do not throw an error upon `ENOENT`).
* Write functions ([`Switch.writeFileSync()`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/functions/writeFileSync)),
  will recursively create parent directories as needed, so manually creating directories
  is rarely necessary.

## Switch.FsFile

[`Switch.FsFile`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/classes/FsFile) is a special implementation
of the web [`File`](/runtime/api/classes/File) class, which interacts with the system's physical
file system. As such, it offers a convenient API for working with existing files, and also
for writing files.

Use the [`Switch.file()`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/functions/file) function to create
instances of `Switch.FsFile`.

### Read as JSON

Reading and parsing a JSON file is a one-liner via the [`json()`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/classes/FsFile#json) function:

```typescript
const topScores = await Switch.file('sdmc:/top-scores.json').json();
console.log(topScores);
```

### Readable stream

To read a file using the [Web Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Streams_API), invoke the [`stream()`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/classes/FsFile#stream)
function which returns a [`ReadableStream`](/runtime/api/classes/ReadableStream) instance:

```typescript
for await (const chunk of Switch.file('sdmc:/data.txt').stream()) {
    console.log(chunk);
}
```

### Writable stream

`Switch.FsFile` may also be used to write files using the web WritableStream API, by accessing the
`writable` property which contains a WritableStream instance:

```typescript
const file = Switch.file('sdmc:/does-not-yet-exist.txt');

const writer = file.writable.getWriter();
await writer.write('write');
await writer.write(' a ');
await writer.write('file ');
await writer.write('incrementally');
await writer.close();
```

> If the file path provided to `Switch.file()` does not yet exist, then a new file will be created
> (as well as any necessary parent directories).

### Big files

If you need to write a file larger than 4gb, your application can create a
"big file" by passing the `bigFile: true` option to `Switch.file()`:

```typescript
const file = Switch.file('sdmc:/test.txt', {
    bigFile: true
});

const writer = file.writable.getWriter();

// … write more than 4gb worth of data to the file …

await writer.close();
```

This works even on FAT32 partitions, which normally have a 4gb limit.

> [!NOTE]
> How "big files" work under the hood is that a directory is created with the
> ["archive" bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_bit) set, which causes
> the directory to be treated as a file containing the directory's concatenated
> contents. This is all handled
> transparently by the operating system, so your application code can treat
> it as if it were a normal file.
