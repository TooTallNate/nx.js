description: Interacting with installed applications
---

The `Switch.Application` API is used to interact with installed applications (game titles) and/or homebrew apps (`.nro` files).

Instances of `Switch.Application` can read the app's title, author information, and other metadata. It is also possible to retrieve a JPEG format image of the title's box art (256 x 256 format).

Additionally, working with [Save Data](./save-data) is preferred to be done by first retrieving the `Switch.Application` instance which your app is interested in working with.

## Instance of current app

Use the special getter `Switch.Application.self` to retrieve an instance of `Switch.Application` which represents
the currently running nx.js application.

```typescript
const app = Switch.Application.self;
console.log(app.title);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using `Switch.Application.self` considers the various methods in which a Switch
> homebrew app can be launched, and loads the correct application metadata accordingly.

## Iterate installed applications

The `Switch.Application` class can be used as an iterator for the purposes of iterating over the installed titles.
This can be useful for i.e. rendering a title launcher screen or gathering information about which titles are currently
installed.

```typescript
let count = 0;
for (const app of Switch.Application) {
    if (app.name.includes('Super')) {
        count++;
    }
}
console.log(`You have ${count} titles which include the word "Super" in the name`);
```

## By Title ID

If you know the specific title ID for an installed application, use the `new Switch.Application(id)` constructor to create an
instance of the class:

```typescript
const app = new Switch.Application(0x0100000000010000b);
console.log(app.title);
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If the specified title is not currently installed on the system, then the accessor methods will throw an error.

## By NRO blob

After reading a homebrew `.nro` file into memory, it is possible to use the `new Switch.Application(nroBlob)` constructor to create
and instance of the class:

```typescript
const nro = await Switch.readFile('sdmc:/hbmenu.nro');
const app = new Switch.Application(nro);
console.log(app.title);
// Logs "Homebrew Menu"
```
