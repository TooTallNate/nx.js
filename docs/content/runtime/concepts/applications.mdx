description: Interacting with installed applications
---

The [`Switch.Application`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/classes/Application) API is used to interact with installed applications (game titles) and/or homebrew apps (`.nro` files).

Instances of `Switch.Application` can read the app's title, author information, and other metadata. It is also possible to retrieve a JPEG format image of the title's box art (256x256 JPEG format).

Additionally, working with [Save Data](./save-data) is preferred to be done by first retrieving the `Switch.Application` instance which your app is interested in working with.

## Instance of current app

Use the special getter [`Switch.Application.self`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/classes/Application#self) to retrieve an instance of `Switch.Application` which represents
the currently running nx.js application.

```typescript
const app = Switch.Application.self;
console.log(app.title);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using `Switch.Application.self` considers the various methods in which a Switch
> homebrew app can be launched, and loads the correct application metadata accordingly.

## Iterate installed applications

The `Switch.Application` class can be used as an iterator for the purposes of iterating over the installed titles.
This can be useful for i.e. rendering a title launcher screen or gathering information about which titles are currently
installed.

```typescript
let count = 0;
for (const app of Switch.Application) {
    if (app.name.includes('Super')) {
        count++;
    }
}
console.log(`You have ${count} titles which include the word "Super" in the name`);
```

## By Title ID

If you know the specific title ID for an installed application, use the `new Switch.Application(id)` constructor to create an
instance of the class:

```typescript
const app = new Switch.Application(0x0100000000010000b);
console.log(app.title);
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If the specified title is not currently installed on the system, then the accessor methods will throw an error.

## By NRO file path

Pass a string or `URL` as a file path to a homebrew `.nro` file to the `new Switch.Application()` constructor to create
and instance of the class with the:

```typescript
const app = new Switch.Application('sdmc:/hbmenu.nro');
console.log(app.title);
// Logs "Homebrew Menu"
```

## Launching an application

Use the `launch()` method to start up the application. This works for both installed titles as well as homebrew applications.
When launching homebrew applications, additional arguments passed to the `launch()` method will be passed along as `argv`.

For example, to launch Retroarch using the snes9x core, and pass the file path of the ROM to start:

```typescript
const app = new Switch.Application('sdmc:/retroarch/cores/snes9x_libretro_libnx.nro');
app.launch('sdmc:/ROMs/SNES/my-rom.sfc');
```
