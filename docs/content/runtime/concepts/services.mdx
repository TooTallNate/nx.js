description: Interacting with system service modules via IPC
---

`libnx`, the core C library used by nx.js to interact with the Switch, contains a
vast number of functions for interacting with various system services in a myriad
of different ways. Many of these functions are higher level wrappers on top of
the Switch's IPC communication mechanism, also known as ["service modules"](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Services_API#Service_List).

It would not be reasonable for nx.js to attempt to expose all of these functions
directly, so instead nx.js provides a low-level API for interacting with these
system modules via IPC, which allows functionality that is not directly exposed by
nx.js to be implemented in userland.

> [!WARNING]
This is a low-level API which is not recommended to be used directly in most cases.
You should look for an npm package which provides a higher-level API for the service
you are trying to interact with.

## Porting libnx functions to nx.js

### Example with output value

Let's say you want your application to retrieve the current system region code. In `libnx`,
this can be done using the `setGetRegionCode()` function, which is exposed by the
[`set`](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Settings_services#set) service module.

However, nx.js does not directly expose this function, so your app can use the
`Switch.Service` class to interact with the `set` service module.

To do this correctly, you may need to reference the [libnx source code](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx)
to understand which command ID and parameters are required for the command
you are attempting to port.

For example, the [`setGetRegionCode()` function](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx/blob/e79dd7ac52cc7fdc41134c9b55e6f55ec8b8799f/nx/source/services/set.c#L216-L221) is implemented as follows:

```c title="libnx/source/services/set.c"
Result setGetRegionCode(SetRegion *out) {
    s32 code=0;
    Result rc = _setCmdNoInOutU32(&g_setSrv, (u32*)&code, 4);
    if (R_SUCCEEDED(rc) && out) *out = code;
    return rc;
}
```

Based on this implementation, we can see that:

* [`set`](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Settings_services#set) is the named service module
* The command ID is `4`
* There is no input data
* The output data is a [region code](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Settings_services#RegionCode), which is a `u32` value

Porting this function to nx.js would look like this:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
const setSrv = new Switch.Service('set');

function getRegionCode() {
	const code = new Uint32Array(1);
	setSrv.dispatchOut(4, code.buffer);
	return code[0];
}

console.log(getRegionCode());
```

### Example with input value

Let's say you want to interact with a function which takes an input value, such as `setsysSetRegionCode()`.

The [`setsysSetRegionCode()` function](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx/blob/e79dd7ac52cc7fdc41134c9b55e6f55ec8b8799f/nx/source/services/set.c#L546-L548) is implemented as follows:

```c title="libnx/source/services/set.c"
Result setsysSetRegionCode(SetRegion region) {
    return _setCmdInU32NoOut(&g_setsysSrv, region, 57);
}
```

* [`set:sys`](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Settings_services#set:sys) is the named service module
* The command ID is `57`
* The input data is a [region code](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Settings_services#RegionCode), which is a `u32` value
* There is no output data

Porting this function to nx.js would look like this:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
const setSysSrv = new Switch.Service('set:sys');

function setRegionCode(region: number) {
	setSysSrv.dispatchIn(57, new Uint32Array([region]).buffer);
}

const regionCode = 1; // SetRegion_USA
setRegionCode(regionCode);
```

### Example with buffers

Some commands require use of input and/or output buffers, such as `setGetAvailableLanguageCodes()`. Let's take a look at how to port this function to nx.js.

The [`setGetAvailableLanguageCodes()` function](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx/blob/e79dd7ac52cc7fdc41134c9b55e6f55ec8b8799f/nx/source/services/set.c#L187-L204) is implemented as follows (some parts are omitted for brevity):

```c title="libnx/source/services/set.c"
Result setGetAvailableLanguageCodes(s32 *total_entries, u64 *LanguageCodes, size_t max_entries) {
    return serviceDispatchOut(&g_setSrv, 5, *total_entries,
        .buffer_attrs = { SfBufferAttr_HipcMapAlias | SfBufferAttr_Out },
        .buffers = { { LanguageCodes, max_entries*sizeof(u64) } },
    );
}
```

* [`set`](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Settings_services#set) is the named service module
* The command ID is `5`
* There is no input data
* The output data is a `s32` number representing the number of entries that were returned
* The output buffer is an array of `u64` values, which represent the available language codes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Additionally, looking at the [Switchbrew wiki for `LanguageCode`](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Settings_services#LanguageCode),
> we can see that the language codes are represented as a `u64` value, which is _actually_ a NUL-terminated string.

Porting this function to nx.js would look like this:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
import { SfBufferAttr } from '@nx.js/constants';

const setSrv = new Switch.Service('set');

function getAvailableLanguageCodes() {
    const totalEntriesArr = new Int32Array(1);
    const languageCodesBuf = new ArrayBuffer(20 * 8);
    setSrv.dispatchOut(5, totalEntriesArr.buffer, {
        bufferAttrs: [SfBufferAttr.HipcMapAlias | SfBufferAttr.Out],
        buffers: [languageCodesBuf],
    });

    const decoder = new TextDecoder();
    const languageCodes: string[] = [];

    // Process the output buffer into the list of language codes as strings
    const totalEntries = totalEntriesArr[0];
    for (let i = 0; i < totalEntries; i++) {
        const data = languageCodesBuf.slice(i * 8, i * 8 + 8);
        const nul = new Uint8Array(data).indexOf(0);
        languageCodes.push(decoder.decode(data.slice(0, nul)));
    }

    return languageCodes;
}

console.log(getAvailableLanguageCodes());
```

### Example with output service object

In some cases, the result of a command is itself a new `Switch.Service` instance.

One such example is the [`clkrstOpenSession()` function](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx/blob/e79dd7ac52cc7fdc41134c9b55e6f55ec8b8799f/nx/source/services/clkrst.c#L25-L34):

```c title="libnx/source/services/clkrst.c"
Result clkrstOpenSession(ClkrstSession* session_out, PcvModuleId module_id, u32 unk) {
    const struct {
        u32 module_id;
        u32 unk;
    } in = { module_id, unk };
    return serviceDispatchIn(&g_clkrstSrv, 0, in,
        .out_num_objects = 1,
        .out_objects = &session_out->s,
    );
}
```

In this case, you can create an "uninitialized" `Switch.Service` instance (by
omitting the `name` from the constructor), and then pass the instance to the
`outObjects` option in the dispatch function:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
const clkrstSrv = new Switch.Service('clkrst');

function openSession(moduleId: number) {
    const sessionSrv = new Switch.Service();
    const inArr = new Uint32Array([moduleId, 3]);
    clkrstSrv.dispatchIn(0, inArr.buffer, {
        outObjects: [sessionSrv],
    });
    return sessionSrv;
}

const moduleId = 0x40000001; // PcvModuleId_CpuBus
const session = openSession(moduleId);
// Dispatch additional commands to the session service instance
```
