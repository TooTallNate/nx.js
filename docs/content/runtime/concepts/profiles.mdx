description: Interacting with user profiles

The [`Switch.Profile`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/classes/Profile) API is used
to interact with user accounts/profiles which exist on the system.

Instances of `Switch.Profile` can read a profile's unique identifier (UID), nickname,
and even retrieve the JPEG image contents of the profile image.

## The "current" profile

When an nx.js application is launched with a preselected user, then the
[`Switch.Profile.current`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/classes/Profile#current)
property will be set to a `Switch.Profile` instance representing the user that the
app was launched with.

You may _set_ the `Switch.Profile.current` property to force the "current" profile to
the specified profile. Doing so will prevent the user selection modal from being
shown when accessing [`localStorage`](/runtime/api/variables/localStorage).

> [!NOTE]
> The `localStorage` API utilizes this value to determine which user profile to associate the data with.


## User selection modal

To explicitly trigger the built-in user selection modal (i.e. the one you see when
launching a game title), invoke the
[`Switch.Profile.select()`](/runtime/api/namespaces/Switch/classes/Profile#select) function.
A `Switch.Profile` instance is returned if the user selected a profile,
or `null` if the user canceled the modal.

```typescript
const profile = Switch.Profile.select();
if (profile) {
    console.log(`You selected profile for "${profile.nickname}"`);
} else {
    console.log(`You canceled the user selection modal`);
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> The user selection modal is _synchronous_, so it will __block the event loop__
> until the user selects a profile.

## Iterate user profiles

The `Switch.Profile` class can be used as an iterator for the purposes of iterating over all user profiles.
This can be useful for i.e. listing out all user profiles by nickname.

```typescript
for (const profile of Switch.Profile) {
    console.log(profile.nickname)
}
```

Or perhaps you want to find a profile by a specific nickname:

```typescript
const profile = Switch.Profile.find(p => p.nickname === 'Nate');
```

## By Profile UID

If you know the specific UID for an existing profile, use the `new Switch.Profile(uid)` constructor to create an
instance of the class:

```typescript
const profile = new Switch.Profile([
  0x10005d4864d166b7n,
  0x965b8cb028cd8a81n,
]);
console.log(profile.nickname);
```
