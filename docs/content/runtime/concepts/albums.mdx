title: Photo Albums
description: Working with the screenshot / video albums
---

nx.js offers APIs for interacting with the "photo album" content stores on the system.
Entries in albums are either screenshots (JPEG image files) or movie recordings (MP4 video files).

There are two separate albums - one on the SD card and the other on the system internal memory (NAND).
Your nx.js app will need to specify which of the albums it intends to interact with.

## Example

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
import { CapsAlbumStorage } from '@nx.js/constants';

// Create `Switch.Album` instance for the SD card album
const album = new Switch.Album(CapsAlbumStorage.Sd);

// Iterate over each entry in the album
for (const file of album) {
    console.log(file);
}
```
