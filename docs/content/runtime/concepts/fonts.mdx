description: Built-in fonts and custom fonts for use with the Canvas API
---

When your application is using [**canvas rendering**](/runtime/rendering/canvas) mode,
nx.js offers a set of built-in fonts which are available for use in your application.
You may also load custom fonts from font files.

## Built-in fonts

nx.js comes with a set of built-in fonts which are available for use in your application.

| Font | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"system-ui"` | The default font which is used by the Switch operating system. |
| `"system-icons"` | A font which contains the icons used by the Switch operating system. |

### system-ui

The default font which is used by the Switch operating system.
The Canvas API's default font `sans-serif` is also an alias for this font.

```typescript
const ctx = screen.getContext('2d');
ctx.font = '48px system-ui';
ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
ctx.fillText('This is the "system-ui" font', 50, 300);
```

### system-icons

The `"system-icons"` font contains icons used by the Switch operating system.
When using this font, you will need to reference the correct unicode codepoint for the icon
when invoking the `fillText()` function to render the icon glyphs.

```typescript
const ctx = screen.getContext('2d');
ctx.font = '48px system-icons';
ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
ctx.fillText('\uE122', 50, 300);
```

## Custom fonts

It is possible to load your own font files into an nx.js application, which involves a few steps:

1. Create a `FontFace` instance
1. Register the font with the `FontFaceSet` registry
1. Use the font with the Canvas API

### Loading a font

To load a font, you'll need to create an instance of the
[`FontFace`](/runtime/api/classes/FontFace) class,
by providing the name of the font and the font data as an `ArrayBuffer`:

```typescript
// Load the font data into a `FontFace` instance
const fontData = await Switch.readFile('romfs:/fonts/Arial.ttf');
const font = new FontFace('Arial', fontData);
```

> The [FreeType 2](https://freetype.org/) library is used to renders fonts,
> so any font file format which is supported by FreeType 2 (typically `.ttf`
> or `.otf`) will work with nx.js.

### Registering a font

Once you've loaded a font, you'll need to register it with the
[`FontFaceSet`](/runtime/api/classes/FontFaceSet) registry.
The [`fonts`](/runtime/api/variables/fonts) global is available for this purpose,
similar to how you would register a font in a "web worker" context.

```typescript
// Add the font to the global `fonts` registry
fonts.add(font);
```

The `fonts` registry is a global object that contains all the fonts that have been
loaded into the application. You can use this registry to render text to the screen
using the Canvas API.

### Example

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
const fontData = await Switch.readFile('romfs:/fonts/Arial.ttf');
const font = new FontFace('Arial', fontData);
fonts.add(font);

// Render to the screen using the Canvas API by setting the "font" property
const ctx = screen.getContext('2d');
ctx.font = '48px Arial';
ctx.fillStyle = 'cyan';
ctx.fillText('This is the "Arial" font', 50, 300);
```
