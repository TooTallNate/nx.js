There are two different rendering modes available for nx.js applications: __console rendering__ or __canvas rendering__.

## Console Rendering

[__Console rendering__](/runtime/rendering/console) mode is useful for text-based applications, which do not require complex graphics or animations.

To use console rendering mode, use the functions available on the global [`console`](/runtime/api/variables/console) object to print text to the console:

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

## Canvas Rendering

[__Canvas rendering__](/runtime/rendering/canvas) mode is useful for graphical user interfaces and games.
It allows you to draw to the screen using the [web Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API),
which provides a low-level interface for drawing shapes, images, and text to the screen.

To use canvas rendering mode, invoke the [`screen.getContext()`](/runtime/api/classes/Screen#getcontext) function to get access to a canvas rendering context:

```js
const ctx = screen.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
```

> Currently only the `"2d"` rendering context is supported. The `"webgl"` context is planned for a future release (see [#131](https://github.com/TooTallNate/nx.js/pull/131)).
