description: Logging to the Console for text based applications
---

If your application is purely text-based, you can use the familiar
`console` global to write textual data to the screen of the application
in the terminal-like interface that [`libnx`](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx) provides.

> To draw more intricate graphics, you should use the [Canvas API](/runtime/rendering/canvas).

## Example

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

## ANSI Escape Codes

Listed below is a (non-exhaustive) list of npm modules known to work well with nx.js when using the Console renderer:

* [`kluer`](https://github.com/lukeed/kleur) - Output colored text with ANSI escape codes
* [`sisteransi`](https://github.com/terkelg/sisteransi) - ANSI escape sequences for moving the cursor

## Limitations

It is worth noting that the terminal interface that `libnx` provides
has dimensions of 80 x 45 characters, supports a limited set of unicode characters,
and provides no customization options for the appearance of the text.

> There is a work-in-progress `@nx.js/terminal` package
> (see [#112](https://github.com/TooTallNate/nx.js/pull/112)), which will provide
> a more full-featured terminal interface powered by [`xterm.js`](https://xtermjs.org),
> which will allow for more control over the visual appearance of your application.
