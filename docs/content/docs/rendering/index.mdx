nx.js applications can be rendered in two different modes: __console rendering__ or __canvas rendering__.

## Console Rendering

The [__console rendering__](/docs/rendering/console) mode is the default rendering mode for nx.js applications.
It is useful for applications that do not require complex graphics or animations.

To use the console rendering mode, you can use the `console` global object to print text to the console.

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

## Canvas Rendering

The [__canvas rendering__](/docs/rendering/canvas) mode is useful for applications that require complex graphics or animations.
It allows you to draw to the screen using the Canvas API, which provides a powerful and flexible way to create visually stunning applications.

To use the canvas rendering mode, you can use the `screen` object to get access to a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` instance.

```js
const ctx = screen.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
```
