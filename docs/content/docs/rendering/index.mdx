nx.js applications can be rendered in two different modes: __console rendering__ or __canvas rendering__.

## Console Rendering

The [__console rendering__](/docs/rendering/console) mode is useful for applications that do not require complex graphics or animations.

To use the console rendering mode, simply use the functions available on the global `console` object to print text to the console:

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

## Canvas Rendering

The [__canvas rendering__](/docs/rendering/canvas) mode is useful for applications that require complex graphics or animations.
It allows you to draw to the screen using the Canvas API, which provides a powerful and flexible way to create visually stunning applications.

To use the canvas rendering mode, use the `screen.getContext()` function to get access to a canvas rendering context:

```js
const ctx = screen.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
```

> Currently only the `"2d"` rendering context is supported. The `"webgl"` context is planned for a future release (see [#131](https://github.com/TooTallNate/nx.js/pull/131)).
