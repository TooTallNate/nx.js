description: Drawing to the screen using the Canvas API
---

nx.js does not implement a full DOM for rendering content to the screen.
Instead, it offers the more low-level Canvas API which allows your application
to draw to the screen.

The global `screen` object is used to create a `CanvasRenderingContext2D`
instance, at which point the app is in __canvas rendering__ mode.

> You should avoid using any `console` printing functions when in __canvas rendering__ mode.
> Doing so will change the app back to [__console rendering__](/docs/rendering/console) mode.

## Example

Let's draw a simple house with the Canvas API:

```js
// Creating the canvas context enters "canvas rendering" mode
const ctx = screen.getContext('2d');

// The default background color is black, so draw the house as white
ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
ctx.strokeStyle = 'white';

// Set line width
ctx.lineWidth = 10;

// Wall
ctx.strokeRect(75, 140, 150, 110);

// Door
ctx.fillRect(130, 190, 40, 60);

// Roof
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(50, 140);
ctx.lineTo(150, 60);
ctx.lineTo(250, 140);
ctx.closePath();
ctx.stroke();
```

## Using React

The Canvas API is a low-level API, and it's not very well suited to building
complex UIs. However, it can be used to build simple UIs, and it's also possible
to use React with the Canvas API.

To use React with the Canvas API, you'll need to use a library like
[`react-canvas`](https://github.com/react-canvas/react-canvas).

Here's an example of a simple React app that uses the Canvas API:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Canvas from 'react-canvas';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Canvas
        width={300}
        height={300}
        style={{ border: '1px solid black' }}
