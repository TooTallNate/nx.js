description: Logging to the Console for text based applications
---

If your application is purely text-based, you can use the familiar
`console` global to write textual data to the screen of the application
in the terminal-like interface that [`libnx`](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx) provides.

> The __canvas rendering__ mode is the default rendering mode for nx.js applications.
> To draw more intricate graphics, you should use the [Canvas API](/docs/rendering/canvas).

## Example

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

## ANSI Escape Codes

Listed below are npm modules known to work well with nx.js when using the Console renderer:

* [`kluer`](https://github.com/lukeed/kleur) - Output colored text with ANSI escape codes
* [`sisteransi`](https://github.com/terkelg/sisteransi) - ANSI escape sequences for moving the cursor

## Limitations

It is worth noting that the terminal interface that `libnx` provides
has dimensions of 80 x 45 characters, supports a limited set of unicode characters,
and provides no customization options for the appearance of the text.

If you would like more control over the visual appearance of your application,
consider using the `@nx.js/terminal` package, which provides a more
full-featured terminal interface powered by [`xterm.js`](https://xtermjs.org).
