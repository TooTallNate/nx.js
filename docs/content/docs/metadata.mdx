title: Package Metadata
description: Customizing the title, version, author & icon of your nx.js application
---

You will likely want to customize some metadata for your application, as well as use a custom icon:
* Metadata information can be specified by adding specific fields to the `package.json` file
* The icon can be specified by adding a `logo.jpg` file to the root of your project

## Title ID

The title ID of your application is used to uniquely identify your application. This is
primarily relevant when utilizing the [Save Data API](/docs/switch/save-data) via `localStorage`.

To set the title ID of your application, add a `titleId` field to your `package.json` file.
It should contain a 16-character hexadecimal string which starts with `01` and ends with `0000`:

```json
{
  "titleId": "0123456789ab0000",
  … rest of your `package.json` file …
}
```

> The `create-nxjs-app` tool automatically generatess a random title ID for you,
> so normally you will not need to create this field manually.

## Name

To set the title of your application (as shown in the homebrew menu), add either a
`productName` or `name` field to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "productName": "My Application",
  "name": "my-application",
  … rest of your `package.json` file …
}
```

> `productName` takes precedence over `name`, and allows for a "pretty" name to be
> displayed for your app. But it's recommended to specify both fields, since
> package managers will complain if `name` is missing.

## Version

To set the version of your application, add a `version` field to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  … rest of your `package.json` file …
}
```

## Author

To set the author of your application, add an `author` field to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "author": "Nathan Rajlich <n@n8.io>",
  … rest of your `package.json` file …
}
```

## Icon

To set the icon of your application, add a `logo.jpg` file to the root of your project:

```bash
├── logo.jpg
├── package.json
└── src
    └── main.ts
```

> The icon should be a square image. It will be resized to 256x256 pixels. If this file is
> not present, then the default nx.js icon will be used.
