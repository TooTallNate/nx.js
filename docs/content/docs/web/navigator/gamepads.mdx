description: Handling user input on connected controllers

nx.js supports up to __eight__ connected controllers. Your application can use the web
[Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API) to read the
state of these controllers.

The `navigator.getGamepads()` function returns an array of `Gamepad` objects, one for each gamepad connected to the device.

```js
const gamepads = navigator.getGamepads();
for (const gamepad of gamepads) {
  console.log(gamepad.id);
}
```

> Index `0` of the gamepads array is the "main" gamepad, which is a special case that reports the state of both the first connected controller as well as the handheld mode controller.
