description: Loading images for use with the Canvas API

Use the global `Image` constructor to load and decode image assets into a usable
format when used in conjunction with [**canvas rendering**](/docs/rendering/canvas) mode.

```typescript
const img = new Image();

img.onload = () => {
    const ctx = screen.getContext('2d');
    ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
};

img.src = 'https://nxjs.n8.io/logo.png';
```

> Setting the `"src"` property to load image data uses `fetch()` under the hood, so
> [any protocol supported by `fetch()`](/docs/web/fetch) is also supported by the `Image` class.
