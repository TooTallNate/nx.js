Your nx.js application can listen for the `touchstart`, `touchmove`,
and `touchend` events, which work the same way as in web app environments.

> Touch events are dispatched to the global `screen` object.

## Example

```typescript
screen.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => {
  console.log('Touch started at', e.touches[0].clientX, e.touches[0].clientY);
});

screen.addEventListener('touchmove', (e) => {
  console.log('Touch moved at', e.touches[0].clientX, e.touches[0].clientY);
});

screen.addEventListener('touchend', (e) => {
  console.log('Touch ended at', e.touches[0].clientX, e.touches[0].clientY);
});
```
