# 2048 for Nintendo Switch

This is a port of the [original 2048 game](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) (by Gabriele Cirulli) to Nintendo Switch using nx.js.

The core game logic was able to be used unmodified. The main component of this port is a Canvas-based rendering engine instead of the original DOM-based renderer.
