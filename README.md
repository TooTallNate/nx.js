**nx.js** is a framework that enables the development of Nintendo Switch
homebrew applications using JavaScript. Powered by the [QuickJS][] engine,
nx.js provides a streamlined environment for writing homebrew applications
for the Nintendo Switch console.

With nx.js, developers can leverage their JavaScript skills and tools to
create engaging and interactive experiences for the Nintendo Switch platform.
The framework abstracts the underlying low-level details and provides a
high-level JavaScript API that simplifies the development process.

nx.js is designed with Web standards in mind, so familiar APIs like
`setTimeout()`, `fetch()`, `new URL()`, `Canvas` and much more are
supported. If you are familar with web development then you should feel
right at home.

## Features

-   **JavaScript Development**: Write homebrew applications for the Nintendo Switch using JavaScript, a popular and widely supported programming language.
-   **High-Level API**: Benefit from a high-level JavaScript API designed specifically for the Nintendo Switch platform, providing easy access to console-specific features and functionality.
-   **Input Handling**: Capture and process user input with ease, including buttons, touch screen, and motion controls, to create engaging gameplay experiences.
-   **Graphics and UI**: Create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces using the web [`Canvas`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) API.
-   **Audio Support**: Integrate audio playback and sound effects into your applications using the web [`Audio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement/Audio) API.
-   **WebAssembly**: Support for executing code compiled to [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/WebAssembly).

### Building from Source

1. Node.js needs to be installed (`curl -sfLS install-node.vercel.app/20 | bash`)
1. `pnpm` needs to be installed (`npm i -g pnpm`)
1. `jq` needs to be installed (`brew install jq`)
1. The [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) compiler toolchain needs to be installed
1. Install required packages from the official registry:
   ```bash
   dkp-pacman -S switch-dev switch-freetype switch-libjpeg-turbo switch-libpng switch-libwebp switch-mbedtls
   ```
1. Install additional packages which are not in the official registry (cairo, pixman, wasm3, harfbuzz, quickjs-ng):
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/tootallnate/pacman-packages:nxjs
   docker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/host ghcr.io/tootallnate/pacman-packages:nxjs sh -c 'cp packages/*/*.pkg.tar.zst /host'
   dkp-pacman -U *.pkg.tar.zst
   ```
1. `qjsc` needs to be installed (**note**: must match the version of the QuickJS dkp package installed in the previous step)
1. Now you can compile one of the example apps into a self-contained `.nro`:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh hello-world
   ```
